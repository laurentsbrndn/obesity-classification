This project presents a comparative analysis of three machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost—to predict obesity levels. The classification task involves seven distinct obesity categories: Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III. Each algorithm is evaluated under three different configurations: default settings, Grid Search, and Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning. In total, nine models were trained and assessed to determine the impact of algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization on prediction accuracy.
